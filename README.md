# Covangers - Covid-19 Vaccination Twitter Sentiment Analysis Model in Indonesia - Indigo Hackathon Festival 2021
Covangers is a B2G (Business to Government) platform for presenting data & analyzing results of public sentiment on COVID-19 vaccination data in DKI Jakarta from Twitter using NLP (Natural Language Processing). This technology is projected to help in the acceleration of COVID-19 vaccinations by mapping location and community sentiment using a psychological and technological approach at the sub-district level in DKI Jakarta. All in all, this platform will help to understand the public reaction and aid the policymakers to project the vaccination campaign as well as health and safety measures in the ongoing global health crisis.

Almost a year and a half from a pandemic, Indonesia is now seeing its worst COVID-19 outbreak. As of early July, more than 2.3 million COVID-19 cases and 63,000 deaths have been confirmed. In response, the country is stepping up public health measures while aiming to accelerate vaccinations and has set a goal of inoculating two million people per day by August. [source]
Indonesia started its vaccination program in January 2021. Based on data from kawalcovid. id, as of April 27, 2021, the positivity rate in Indonesia is still at 16.1%, far above the WHO standard which sets 5% as a normal number. Therefore, vaccination must be carried out in an effort to fight Covid-19 in Indonesia.
Early reports of COVID-19 vaccination may not accurately convey community-level concern about the pandemic during early stages, particularly in Indonesia where vaccination capacity was initially limited. Social media interaction may elucidate public reaction and communication dynamics about COVID-19 vaccination in this critical period, during which communities may have formulated initial conceptions about the perceived severity of the pandemic.


From the perspective of behavioral science, one of the human weaknesses is sometimes they get disconnected from their future selves. Dynamical communication in Twitter will affect human decisions to get vaccinated or not. We need help from the government to garner trust will be essential to their success, and to the emergence of more resilient societies after the crisis.
Public sentiments are different among locations. By knowing where to start counseling, we can get a whole new perspective of its neighborhood and how to create strategies to accelerate vaccination rates in that specific location.

We propose solutions to improve the communication strategy of health organizations and build a location-based community of engaged influencers that support the dissemination of scientific insights, including issues related to vaccines and their safety. All in all, this technology will help the government to win its society so that they want to be vaccinated.
